## `core` Command Set

These represent very common tasks that one is likely to perform in a browser, such as
navigating to URLs, filling in form fields, and performing input with the mouse and keyboard.

### `click`

```
click <SELECTOR> {
    x:            null,
    y:            null,
    unique_match: true
}
```

Click on HTML element(s) or on a specific part of the page.  More complex click operations
are supported (e.g.: double clicking, drag and drop) by supplying **x**/**y** coordinates
directly.

#### Arguments

- **selector** (`str`, optional):

    The page element to focus, given as a CSS-style selector, an ID (e.g. "#myid"), or an
    XPath query (e.g.: "xpath://body/p").

- **x** (`int`, optional):

    If **selector** is not specified, this is the X-coordinate component of the location
    to click at.

- **y** (`int`, optional):

    If **selector** is not specified, this is the Y-coordinate component of the location
    to click at.

- **unique_match** (`bool`):

    For **selector** matches, whether there can be one and only one match to click on. If
    false, every matched element will be clicked on in the order they were matched in.

- **kwargs**:

    Only applies to **x**/**y** click events, see: `webfriend.rpc.Input.click_at`.

#### Returns
A `list` of elements that were clicked on.

#### Raises
For **selector**-based events:

- `webfriend.exceptions.EmptyResult` if zero elements were matched, or
- `webfriend.exceptions.TooManyResults` if more than one elements were matched.

---

### `close_tab`

```
close_tab <TAB_ID>
```

Close the tab identified by the given ID.

#### Arguments

- **tab_id** (`str`):

    The ID of the tab to close.

    client.  Valid values are: `console`, `dom`, `network`, `page`.

- **demo** (`dict`, optional):

    A section describing various runtime options useful for demonstrations and
    walkthroughs.

    - **delay** (`int`, optional):

        If specified, scripts will sleep for this amount of time (in milliseconds) between
        each command that is processed.  This is useful for slowing down the visual
        effects of commands to a rate that is easier to see.

- **user_agent** (`str`, optional):

    If specified, this will be the User-Agent header value that is sent with all HTTP(S)
    requests initiated from here on.

    This is useful for environment variables that contain multiple values joined by a
    separator (e.g: the `PATH` variable.)

#### Returns
The value of the environment variable **name**, or a list of values if **joiner** was
specified. If **name** is non-existent or was empty, **fallback** will be returned instead.

defined at the time of invocation.  They are available to injected scripts as a plain
object accessible using the `this` variable.

#### Arguments

- **body** (`str`, optional):

    A string value that represents the script to be injected and executed.

- **file** (`str`, optional):

```

Evaluates another Friendscript loaded from another file.

#### Arguments

- **script_name** (`str`):

    The filename or basename of the file to search for in the `WEBFRIEND_PATH` environment
    variable to load and evaluate.  The `WEBFRIEND_PATH` variable behaves like the the
    traditional *nix `PATH` variable, wherein multiple paths can be specified as a
    colon-separated (`:`) list.  The current working directory will always be checked
    first.

- **data** (`dict`, optional):

    If specified, these values will be made available to the evaluated script before it
    begins execution.

- **isolated** (`bool`):

    Whether the script should have access to the calling script's variables or not.

- **preserve_state** (`bool`):

    Whether event handlers created in the evaluated script should remain defined after the
    script has completed.

- **merge_scopes** (`bool`):

    Whether the scope state at the end of the script's evaluation should be merged into the
    current execution scope.  Setting this to true allows variables defined inside of the
    evaluated script to stay defined after the script has completed.  Otherwise, only the
    value of the **result_key** variable is returned as the result of this command.

- **result_key** (`str`):

    Defines the name of the variable that will be read from the evaluated script's scope
    and returned from this command.  Defaults to "result", which is the same behavior as
    all other commands.

#### Returns
The value of the variable named by **result_key** at the end of the evaluated script's
execution.

#### Raises
Any exception that can be raised from Friendscript.

This is useful for waiting for events to occur after performing an action, then giving some
amount of time for those events to "settle" (e.g.: allowing the page time to react to those
events without knowing ahead of time what, if any, listeners will be responding.)  A common
use case for this would be to wait a few seconds _after_ a resize has occurred for anything
that just loaded to finish doing so.


#### Arguments

    idle with respect to _any_ events.

- **timeout** (`int`):

    The maximum amount of time to wait before raising a
    `webfriend.exceptions.TimeoutError`.

    element (using the default settings for **width**, **height**, **x**, and **y**) will
    result in taking a screenshot of _just_ that element.

    If a `list` is specified, all elements in the list will be retrieved and the one with
    the largest height will be used.

- **settle** (`int`, optional):

    The number of milliseconds to wait after performing the viewport resize before
    actually capturing the image.  This gives newly-exposed elements time to load.

- **after_events** (`str`, `list`, optional):

    If an event name or list of event names is given, then **settle** will be interpreted
    as an amount of time _after_ the last of these named events has been received. If the
    special value `any` is provided, then **settle** will wait for that amount of time
    since any event has been received to elapse, up to 'settle_timeout' seconds.

- **settle_timeout** (`int`, optional):

    The maximum amount of time to wait for events to stop coming in as described in by
    **after_events**.

- **reply_timeout** (`int`, optional):

    The maximum amount of time to wait for the screenshot call to complete.

- **autoclose** (`bool`):

    If a file handle is given as the **destination**, should it be automatically closed
    when the screenshot is completed.

- **use** (`str`):

    Determines how to handle multiple elements that are matched by **selector**.

    - "tallest":
        Use the tallest element as the result for measuring screenshot dimensions.

    - "first":
        Use the first element matched as the result for measuring screenshot dimensions.

    The final width of the viewport that was captured.

- _height_ (`int`):
    The final height of the viewport that was captured.

- _x_ (`int`):
    The final X-position of the viewport that was captured.

- _y_ (`int`):
